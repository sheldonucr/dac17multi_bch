\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

In this work, for the first time, we propose an analytic method to calculate the stress evolution considering time-varying temperature effects during the void nucleation phase for some multi-branch interconnect trees, including the straight-line there-terminal wires, the T-shaped four-terminal wires and the cross-shaped five-terminal wires. The proposed closed-form expression can be used to calculate the hydrostatic stress evolution with time-varying temperature.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section \ref{sec:analytical_expressions}, we induce the analytical expression for the stress evolution in multi-branch interconnect tree considering constant temperature.Then we extend this model in time-varying temperature environment in Section \ref{sec:dynamic_modeling}. Experimental results for the straight-line there-terminal wires, the T-shaped four-terminal wires and the cross-shaped five-terminal wires are presented in Section \ref{sec:experimental_results}. Concluding remarks are drawn in Section \ref{sec:conclusion}.

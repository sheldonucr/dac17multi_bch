\begin{abstract}

  Electromigration (EM) is the major concern for the VLSI back end of
  the line (BEOL) reliabiliity. For EM modeling and assessment, one
  important problem is to perform fast EM time to failure analysis for
  practical interconnect layouts such as clock and power/ground
  networks consisting of many multi-segment wires.  However, existing
  EM modeling and analysis techniques are mainly developed for a
  single wire. Although there are some early effects to resolve this
  issue, but there is no general analytic and compact model developed
  to estimate the EM-induced stress evolution, which is required to
  predict the time to failure. In this paper, we propose a new analyic
  expression hydrstatic stress calculation for general multi-segment
  interconnect wire with mutiple terminals. The new method is based on
  the Laplace transformation method on the Korhonen's equation with
  blocked atom flux boundary conditons. The analytical solutions in
  terms of a set of auxiliary basis functions using the complementary
  error function agree well with the numerical analysis results. Our
  analysis further demonstrates that using the first two dominant
  basis functions can lead to xx\% error, which is sufficient for
  practical EM analysis.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we have proposed a new analysis methods for multi-terminal interconnect tree considering changing temperature. The new time-varying model show an excellent agreement with the detailed numerical analysis obtained from COMSOL.
